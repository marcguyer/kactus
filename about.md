Looking for a resume? Good luck with that.

No? Ok, then, just the basics:

## The Past

My professional life effectively began when I cofounded [Resite Information Technology](http://resiteit.com/). Amazingly as of this writing, that site remains up. After selling the company in 2007, the name was changed to [Resite Online](http://www.resiteonline.com/). The company was never "offline". Oh, the irony.

## The Present

In 2009, as a cofounder of [SproutBox](http://sproutbox.com), I founded [CheddarGetter](https://cheddargetter.com). I remain today the CEO and Systems Architect for CheddarGetter.

## The Future

Not really sure about that.
